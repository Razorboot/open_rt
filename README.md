> # Introduction
### What is TraceLib?
TraceLib is a retro-style **WIP realtime rendering engine** that utilizes multiple **performance-heavy graphics techniques and optimization strategies.** As a result, **you'll likely encounter lag depending on the complexity of your experience and many features may be buggy and are subject to change**, so feel free to create issues on the Github repo when you encounter bugs!

You can download the engine from the Github repo here.
### Important Features:
The **main user-facing module** is TraceLib/TracerClass . It exposes a complete API for controlling lighting, adjusting render behavior, setting materials, and controlling resolution.

TraceLib currently supports:
- Multithreading
- Global lights (sun)
- Local lights (PointLights only at the moment)
- Direct Illumination (diffuse, specular, hard shadows)
- Custom Materials (with albedo, specular, and normal maps)
- Interlacing (for performance and style!)
